          <p><span class="red redtitle">Impostor: A Journey to Monogamy</span> chronicles author and olympic athlete
            William H. Person’s struggles with
            monogamy and his path to healthier relationships.</p>
          <p>Infidelity is a topic that has touched most people’s lives. During the height of the author’s athletic
            career he had a life-altering epiphany. He looked in the mirror and was sickened at what he had become. The
            word monogamy had somehow disappeared from his vocabulary.</p>
          <p>William reveals the process of how he transitioned from being a serial cheater to a faithful partner. He
            also exposes the patterns of a cheater and the tricks many use to keep their secrets.</p>
